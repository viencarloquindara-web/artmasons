            <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
              <p>
                At ART MASONS, we are driven by a single ambition: to create paintings of true museum quality. We are a small, highly specialised team of artists, academically trained according to European standards, and we never compromise on detail, technique, or materials.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of our reproductions are entirely hand-painted using premium oil paints on linen canvas, never printed, never digitally produced. Each artist in our studio is a master in their discipline: some specialise in Renaissance techniques, others in Baroque or Rococo, while others excel in Impressionism.
              </p>
              <p>
                This depth of expertise enables us not only to replicate the precise details of an original painting, but also to capture the distinctive style, brushwork, and artistic language of every old master. These capabilities are the result of many years of rigorous academic training and hands-on experience. It is for this reason that our ART MASONS art studio proudly holds one of the strongest reputations in the market for master-level reproduction art.

            <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How Long Will It Take to Create My Painting?</h2>
            <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
              <p>
                Creating a hand-painted reproduction of museum quality requires patience, precision, and time. Each artwork is painted entirely by hand and must also be allowed to dry fully before it can be safely shipped.
              </p>
              <p>
                On average, we require 8 to 10 weeks from the moment your order and payment are received until your painting is ready for dispatch.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exact timeframe may vary depending on the complexity of the original artwork and, to a lesser extent, the size of the piece. More intricate paintings naturally require additional time to ensure every detail is faithfully reproduced.

              <p>
                We ship our paintings using globally recognised and reputable courier companies to ensure safe and reliable delivery. If you would like to track your shipment, we will provide an online tracking number via email as soon as your painting has been dispatched.
              </p>
              <p>
                All unframed art reproductions are carefully rolled and placed into secure, protective postal tubes to prevent any damage during transit.

              <p>
                Please note that we do not ship to P.O. Boxes. A physical home or business address is required for all deliveries to ensure safe and successful receipt of your artwork.

            <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
              <p>
                Many websites offering painting reproductions provide standard sizes that often do not match the proportions of the original artwork. Our approach is entirely different. We offer our hand-painted reproductions either in the exact size of the original painting or in a size that maintains perfect original proportional accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you would like your painting in a size that is not listed on our website, simply email us on info@artmasons.com with your request. We are happy to guide you and offer bespoke sizing options.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the detailed page of each painting, you will find the available size options along with their prices. If you prefer a custom size, we can recommend the most suitable dimensions, always proportional to the original to perfectly complement your space.

            <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
              <p>
                Our paintings are shipped unstretched and unframed due to international mailing limitations. High-quality oil paintings are valuable and can be easily damaged during transport if shipped already stretched on a frame.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, framing your artwork once it arrives is extremely simple. Any professional frame shop will offer a wide selection of frames to match your style and interior, ranging from wood to metal and high-quality synthetic options. Simply take your rolled canvas to the frame shop, and their specialists will advise you on suitable frame styles, materials, and finishes that best complement your artwork.
